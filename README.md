# JsonDataMaker

JsonDataMaker is a website that you could pick any field you want and convert your data to json format.The website provided two simple API endpoint for you to fetch for your project.

## Inspiration

I got this idea when I was building my last ASP.Net E-commerce Project, I had a hard time looking for data to show, even if I just wanted a few data, and I didn't want to pay or get in trouble with license issue.So I built a console app in C# to build json, and this website is a step further using the idea.

## API Endpoints

There are two endpoints completely free to use and license free for now.
